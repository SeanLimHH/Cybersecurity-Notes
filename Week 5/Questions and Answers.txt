The following are True/False questions:


Q1. There is no difference between addition and subtraction operation for all
elements of GF(3).

False.

Since now there are 3 possible values (0, 1, 2), consider this example:
Due to the fact that these are the only possible values,
0 - 1 will have to wrap around and hence be 2.
Then, if you observe 0 + 1, you will get 1 due to no wrap around. With this, we can see that the statement is false.

Q2. There is no difference between addition and subtraction operation for all
elements of GF(2N), for any integer N.

True.

The reason is that the addition and subtraction operations involve bitwise XOR and that there is no carry. This means
that even if you increase the bits from 2 to 4 to 8 or to 16, the effect of bitwise XOR maintains; the end result for
addition in 2-bits is the same for subtraction in 2-bits. This effect is the same for 4-bits, 8-bits, 16-bits, ...

Q3. For all elements of GF(2), multiplication is equivalent to an AND gate.

True.

For modular arithmetics in GF(2), multiplication is thought of as tensor-producting two vectors, hence it is the same 
as multiplying each element from both vectors. As a result, in each of the multiplication of the two elements, it 
is an AND operation (because we are dealing with 0 and 1 only).
An example is from the notes, where when we expand out a polynomial multiplication,(a1x+a0)·(b1x+b0)=a1b1x
2+(a1b0+a0b1)x+a0b0.
When expanded, one can see that there is bitwise AND operation conducted due to the nature of only 0 and 1 existing
in the field.

For 0 and 1, 0·1 = 0 and this is equivalent to AND(0,1). Similarly for 1·0 = 0 = AND(1,0); 0·0 = 0 = AND(0,0);
1·1 = AND(1,1).

Q4. A polynomial of degree 8 is a possible element of the field GF(2^8).

False.

In GF(2^n), the highest permissible power of an element is n-1. For GF(2^8), the highest permissible power of any
element in the polynomial is 7 and cannot exceed this number (cannot be >= 8).

Q5. P(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 is a irreducible polynomial.

False.

The polynomial is reducible. 
P(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1. This is the same as ((x+1)^2)·(x^2-x+1) = P(x). As a result, the polynomial is not a 
irreducible polynomial.
